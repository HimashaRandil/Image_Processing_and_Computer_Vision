tensorflow is good model for deeplearning 
on the platform of tensorflow kera has been developed
kera is wrapper for tensorflow because it helps to deal with tensorflow logics with less codes

dense neural networks are costly and need high comuptational power and takes too much time
dense neural networks might cause for over fitting 

ResNet
MobileNet
RetinaNet

These are not dense networks. they are having diffrent connection with neurons and works efficiently.

In image augmentation we apply artificial variation for same image 
Using that it can expand the dataset
For data augmentation albumentation  and roboflow website

Freezing
we freez top layer to unfreez because the vgg model train on image net dataset and already learned shape
patterns and when model's bottom layer learn from the phenumonia data and crossfitting that knowledge with top
layer to identi
